As we experience positive emotions such as gratitude, loving-kindness, and compassion, our awareness broadens and our creativity and problem-solving capacities blossom, and we become more effective in whatever we choose to do.</p>\n\n<p>1. To begin, find a safe, quiet place where you know you will not be disturbed. Please don\u2019t listen to this recording while you are driving.</p>\n\n<p>2. We will keep track of time for you, and ring a gentle chime when 10 minutes have elapsed\u00a0[start timer].</p>\n\n<p>3. Sit upright in a comfortable, stable position where you feel fully supported, and your back, neck, and head are straight. Or lie down on your back in a comfortable place, with some support under your knees. Make sure you\u2019ll be warm enough. You might want to get a sweater or blanket if the room is cool. Loosen any restrictive clothing that would prevent you from breathing comfortably.</p>\n\n<p>4. Allow your eyes to gently close or maintain a soft focus, gazing 6-12 feet in front of you.</p>\n\n<p>5. Take a slow, deep breath to bring yourself to the present moment and begin the process of feeling more peaceful and centered. Breathe into the belly so it expands as you breathe in and gets smaller as you breathe out.</p>\n\n<p>6. Now, take a minute or two to mentally scan your body for any areas where there is tightness, tension, or soreness and breathe your warm, oxygen-filled breath into that area; as you breathe out, let the tension release, breathing it out.</p>\n\n<p>7. Now, notice any worries, fear, anger, irritation, jealousy, or judgment. Just breathe into those emotions, noting them, and allowing them to flow out as you breathe out. Another breath into any uncomfortable emotions, and breathing out, releasing them [5 seconds].</p>\n\n<p>8. Now any thoughts of memories, plans, associations, anything other than being here, breathing, just breathe into those thoughts, and as you breathe out, allow the thoughts to flow out with the breath [5 seconds].</p>\n\n<p>9. Now that our bodies, emotions, and thoughts are a little clearer, a bit more spacious and open, we can begin to focus on the events, experiences, people, pets, or possessions for which we feel grateful [5 seconds].</p>\n\n<p>10. First, recall that if you are listening to this recording, you already have several marvelous gifts:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The gift of life itself, the most precious gift. Someone gave birth to you, someone fed you as an infant, changed your diaper, clothed you, bathed you, taught you to speak and to understand.</li>\n\t<li>The gift of hearing, so you can hear and learn\u2014whether it\u2019s the song of a bird, the notes of a band or orchestra, the songs of singing and voices, the sound of your own breath flowing in and flowing out.</li>\n\t<li>The gift of a heartbeat, steady, regular, moment after moment, pumping fresh, life-giving blood to all your organs [5 seconds].</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now think about all the things we have today that make our lives easier and more comfortable than they were for our great-grandparents.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>We flip a switch, and light appears.</li>\n\t<li>We turn a tap and clean, drinkable water flows.</li>\n\t<li>We adjust a thermostat, and a room grows warmer or cooler.</li>\n\t<li>We have a roof to keep us dry when it rains, walls to keep out the cold wind, windows to let in the light, screens to keep out insects.</li>\n\t<li>We enter a vehicle and it takes us where we want to go.</li>\n\t<li>We have access to machines that wash our clothes. And we have clothes to wear, places to store them.</li>\n\t<li>There are machines that store our food at just the right temperature and help us cook it without us having to gather wood.</li>\n\t<li>We have indoor plumbing.</li>\n\t<li>We have public libraries that have thousands of books and recordings, free for anyone to borrow and read.</li>\n\t<li>We have public schools that can teach us to read and write, skills that were available to only the very few just a few hundred years ago [5 seconds].</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now, take a moment to reflect on all the thousands of people who have worked hard, some without knowing you at all, to make your life easier or more pleasant.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Some who plant, grow, and harvest your food.</li>\n\t<li>Some who transport that food to market.</li>\n\t<li>A team of people who make the roads and railways that make it easier to transport the food.</li>\n\t<li>Another team who maintain those vehicles. And drivers, loaders, unloaders.</li>\n\t<li>Those who take the time to design the store, the shelves, the packaging that keeps the food safe and allows you to find what you need.</li>\n\t<li>Postal service. Someone who sorts the mail. Others who deliver it.</li>\n\t<li>Those who maintain the servers so you can get and send email and access the Internet.</li>\n\t<li>Those who design operations and systems for gathering, sorting, and disposing of trash and recycling.</li>\n\t<li>Those who gather news stories and photos, and those who create the many mechanisms by which the news can reach you.</li>\n\t<li>All those who play sports, create art or music, or plays or poems or films to entertain and uplift you.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And most of these are people you have never met or barely know.</p>\n\n<p>11. Now, consider the people and pets you know who enrich your life, those who smile at you and cheer you on, those family, friends, acquaintances, colleagues, and peers, those ancestors who worked so you could live well, those friends who support you when you need a shoulder or a hand [5 seconds].</p>\n\n<p>12. Now, take a moment to reflect on your own reasons for feeling grateful in this moment [15 seconds].</p>\n\n<p>13. There is so much to feel grateful for in this moment now\u00a0[10 seconds]. Gratitude fills our hearts and minds, uplifting our spirit [10 seconds].</p>\n\n<p>14. When you finish [CHIME], you can notice the feeling of your body and breath in this place. Rest quietly for several minutes, noticing how you feel throughout your body, emotions, and thoughts compared with before you started. No judging, just noticing. Gently stretch your hands and arms, feet and legs. If you choose to stand, do so slowly. With practice, you can find yourself feeling grateful easily, wherever you are. You may choose to keep a journal, noting three to five things each day for which you feel particularly grateful. You can draw on the strength of this gratitude whenever you wish.</p>\n\n<p>15. Thank you for practicing this guided heart-centered meditation to promote a sense of gratitude.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "id": 1, "rating": "60", "difficulty": "Casual", "title": "Gratitude Meditation", "description": "Feel grateful as you reflect on all the gifts in your life.", "duration": ["10", "mins"], "categories": ["gratitude"], "img": "https://ggia.berkeley.edu/images/made/assets/general/Gratitude_Meditation_Fb_214_162_s_c1.jpg", "frequency": ["1x", "day"]},

Let your eyes explore every part of it, examining the\u00a0highlights where the light shines, the darker hollows, the folds and ridges, and any asymmetries or unique features.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3.\u00a0Touching:</strong>\u00a0Turn the raisin over between your fingers, exploring its texture.\u00a0Maybe do this with your eyes closed if that enhances your sense of touch.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4.\u00a0Smelling:</strong>\u00a0Hold the raisin beneath your nose. With each inhalation, take in\u00a0any smell, aroma, or fragrance that may arise. As you do this, notice anything\u00a0interesting that may be happening in your mouth or stomach.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>5.\u00a0Placing:</strong>\u00a0Now slowly bring the raisin up to your lips, noticing how your hand\u00a0and arm know exactly how and where to position it. Gently place the raisin in\u00a0your mouth; without\u00a0chewing, noticing how it gets into your mouth in the first place. Spend a few moments focusing on the sensations of having it in your mouth, exploring it with your tongue.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>6.\u00a0Tasting:</strong> When you are ready, prepare to chew the raisin, noticing how and\u00a0where it needs to be for chewing. Then, very consciously, take one or two bites into it and notice\u00a0what happens in the aftermath, experiencing any waves of taste that emanate from it as you continue chewing. Without swallowing yet, notice the bare sensations of\u00a0taste and texture in your mouth and how these may change over time, moment by moment. Also pay\u00a0attention to any changes in the object itself.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>7.\u00a0Swallowing:</strong>\u00a0When you feel ready to swallow the raisin, see if you can first\u00a0detect the intention to swallow as it comes up, so that even this is experienced consciously before\u00a0you actually swallow the raisin.</p>\n\n<p><strong>8.\u00a0Following:</strong>\u00a0Finally, see if you can feel what is left of the raisin moving down\u00a0into your stomach, and sense how your body as a whole is feeling after you\u00a0have completed this\u00a0exercise.<br>\n\u00a0</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "id": 12, "rating": "96", "difficulty": "Casual", "title": "Raisin Meditation", "description": "Cultivate mindfulness, reduce stress, and enjoy everyday pleasures.", "duration": ["5", "mins"], "categories": ["mindfulness", "resilience_to_stress"], "img": "https://ggia.berkeley.edu/images/made/assets/general/GGIA-RaisinMeditation_214_162_s_c1.jpg", "frequency": ["1x", "day"]},

Try to make time for this practice at least once per week.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h4>How to Do It</h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Find a quiet place where you can talk with a conversation partner without interruption or distraction. Invite him or her to share what\u2019s on his or her mind. As he or she does so, try to follow the steps below. You don\u2019t need to cover every step, but the more you do cover, the more effective this practice is likely to be.</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li><strong>Paraphrase.</strong>\u00a0Once the other person has finished expressing a thought, paraphrase what he or she said to make sure you understand and to show that you are paying attention. Helpful ways to paraphrase include \u201cWhat I hear you saying is\u2026\u201d \u201cIt sounds like\u2026\u201d and \u201cIf I understand you right\u2026.\u201d</li>\n\t<li><strong>Ask questions.\u00a0</strong>When appropriate, ask questions to encourage the other person to elaborate on his or her thoughts and feelings. Avoid jumping to conclusions about what the other person means. Instead,\u00a0ask questions to clarify his or her meaning, such as, \u201cWhen you say_____, do you mean_____\u201d?\u00a0</li>\n\t<li><strong>Express empathy.</strong>\u00a0If the other person voices negative feelings, strive to validate these feelings rather than questioning or defending against them. For example, if the speaker expresses frustration, try to consider why he or she feels that way, regardless of whether you think that feeling is justified or whether you would feel that way yourself were you in his or her position.\u00a0You\u00a0might respond, \u201cI can sense that you\u2019re feeling frustrated,\u201d and even \u201cI can understand how that situation could cause frustration.\u201d</li>\n\t<li><strong>Use engaged body language.</strong>\u00a0Show that you are engaged and interested by\u00a0making eye contact, nodding, facing the other person, and maintaining an open and relaxed body posture. Avoid attending to distractions in your environment or checking your phone. Be mindful of your facial expressions: Avoid expressions that might communicate disapproval or disgust.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Avoid judgment.</strong>\u00a0Your goal is to understand the other person\u2019s perspective and accept it for what it is, even if you disagree with it. Try not to interrupt with counter-arguments or mentally prepare a rebuttal while the other person is speaking.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Avoid giving advice.</strong>\u00a0Problem-solving is likely to be more effective after\u00a0both conversation partners understand one another\u2019s perspective and feel heard. Moving too quickly into advice-giving can be counterproductive.\u00a0</li>\n\t<li><strong>Take turns.\u00a0</strong>After the other person has had a chance to speak and you have engaged in the active listening steps above, ask if it\u2019s okay for you to share your perspective. When sharing your perspective, express yourself as clearly as possible using \u201cI\u201d statements (e.g., \u201cI feel overwhelmed when you don\u2019t help out around the house\u201d). It may also be helpful, when relevant, to express empathy for the other person\u2019s perspective (e.g., \u201cI know you\u2019ve been very busy lately and don\u2019t mean to leave me hanging\u2026\u201d).</li>\n</ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "id": 5, "rating": "91", "difficulty": "Intensive", "title": "Active Listening", "description": "Connect with a partner through empathy and understanding.", "duration": ["10", "mins"], "categories": ["featured", "connection", "empathy"], "img": "https://ggia.berkeley.edu/images/made/assets/general/GGIA-ActiveListening_214_162_s_c1.jpg", "frequency": ["1x", "week"]},

Focus on how constructive changes could make you feel happier, healthier, or more fulfilled, and avoid judging yourself.</li>\n\t<li>After writing the letter, put it down for a little while.

(For specific ideas for where to take an awe walk, see the list lower down.)</p>\n\n<p>To get started, turn off your cell phone.\u00a0Cell phones (and other gadgets) can be distracting and draw your attention away from what\u2019s happening around you. Even better, don\u2019t bring your phone with you at all so that you won\u2019t be tempted to check it.</p>\n\n<p>During your walk, try to approach what you see with fresh eyes, imagining that you\u2019re seeing it for the first time. Then follow these steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Take a deep breath in. Count to six as you inhale and six as you exhale. Feel the air move through your nasal passages and hear the sound of your breath. Come back to this breath throughout the walk.</li>\n\t<li>As you start to walk, feel your feet on the ground and listen to the surrounding sounds.\u00a0</li>\n\t<li>Shift your awareness now so that you are open to what is around you, to things that are vast, unexpected, things that surprise\u00a0and delight.</li>\n\t<li>Take another deep breath in. Again, count to six as you inhale and six as you exhale.\u00a0</li>\n\t<li>Let your attention be open in exploration for what inspires awe in you. Is it a wide landscape? The small patterns of light and shadow? Let your attention move from the vast to the small.</li>\n\t<li>Continue your walk, and every so often, bring your attention back to your breath. Count to six as you inhale and six as you exhale. Notice\u2014really notice\u2014the multitude of sights, sounds, smells, and other sensations that are dancing through your awareness, usually undetected.\u00a0</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Once you get in the habit of taking walks like this, you may be struck by\u00a0how frequently you have opportunities to experience awe\u2014they are practically infinite.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>As you move through your day, take note of the moments that bring you wonder, that give you goosebumps: These are your opportunities for awe. They may be in city areas, in front of art, listening to music, or connecting with others.\u00a0Go out and find your awe moments and listen to them carefully, see where they guide you. As they stir humility and wonder, you may disover that they\u00a0point you toward\u00a0what you're supposed to do while you're here on Earth.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some more specific ideas for where to take an awe-inspiring walk.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Natural settings:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>A mountain with panoramic views</li>\n\t<li>A trail lined with tall trees</li>\n\t<li>The shore of an ocean, lake, river, or waterfall</li>\n\t<li>A clear night when you can see the stars</li>\n\t<li>A place where you can watch a sunset or sunrise\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Urban settings:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The top of a skyscraper\u2026 or look up in an area dense with tall buildings</li>\n\t<li>A historic monument</li>\n\t<li>A part of your city that you\u2019ve never explored before</li>\n\t<li>A large ballpark or stadium</li>\n\t<li>A city art walk and explore different galleries</li>\n\t<li>Botanical gardens or a zoo to see plants and animal species you\u2019ve never seen before</li>\n\t<li>Walk around with no destination in mind and see where it takes you</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Indoor settings:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>A planetarium or aquarium</li>\n\t<li>A historic mansion, cathedral, or opera house</li>\n\t<li>Walk slowly around a museum, giving your full attention to each piece</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For more guidance, check out this\u00a0360\u00b0 guided Awe Walk practice through Muir Woods National Monument with the Greater Good Science Center's Dacher Keltner:</p>\n\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TKterwanr1Y\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "id": 2, "rating": "73", "difficulty": "Moderate", "title": "Awe Walk", "description": "Find wonder and inspiration through a simple stroll.", "duration": ["15", "mins"], "categories": ["awe", "happiness", "kindness"], "img": "https://ggia.berkeley.edu/images/made/assets/general/AweWalk-Crop_214_162_s_c1.jpg", "frequency": ["1x", "week"]},

Think of a situation in your life that is difficult and is causing you stress.</p>\n\n<p>2. Call the situation to mind and see if you can actually feel the stress and emotional discomfort in your body.</p>\n\n<p>3. Now say to yourself, \u201cThis is a moment of suffering.\u201d This acknowledgment is a form of mindfulness\u2014of simply noticing what is going on for you emotionally in the present moment, without judging that experience as good or bad. You can also say to yourself, \u201cThis hurts,\u201d or, \u201cThis is stress.\u201d Use whatever statement feels most natural to you.</p>\n\n<p>4. Next, say to yourself, \u201cSuffering is\u00a0a part of life.\u201d This is a recognition of your common humanity with others\u2014that all people have trying experiences, and these experiences give you something in common with the rest of humanity rather than mark you as abnormal or deficient. Other options for this statement include \u201cOther people feel this way,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not alone,\u201d or \u201cWe all struggle in our lives.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>5. Now, put your hands over your heart, feel the warmth of your hands and the gentle touch on your chest, and say, \u201cMay I be kind to myself.\u201d This is a way to express self-kindness. You can also consider whether there is another specific phrase that would speak to you in that particular situation. Some examples: \u201cMay I give myself the compassion that I need,\u201d \u201cMay I accept myself as I am,\u201d \u201cMay I learn to accept myself as I am,\u201d \u201cMay I forgive myself,\u201d \u201cMay I be strong,\u201d and \u201cMay I be patient.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>This practice can be used any time of day or night. If you practice it in moments of relative calm, it might become easier for you to experience the three parts of self-compassion\u2014mindfulness, common humanity, and self-kindness\u2014when you need them most.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "id": 10, "rating": "90", "difficulty": "Casual", "title": "Self-Compassion Break", "description": "A healthier way to deal with stressful situations.", "duration": ["5", "mins"], "categories": ["happiness", "mindfulness", "resilience_to_stress", "self-comp"], "img": "https://ggia.berkeley.edu/images/made/assets/general/GGIA-SelfCompassionBreak_214_162_s_c1.jpg", "frequency": ["1x", "day"]},

Find a lane that allows you to walk back and forth for 10-15 paces\u2014a place that is relatively peaceful, where you won\u2019t be disturbed or even observed (since a slow, formal walking meditation can look strange to people who are unfamiliar with it). You can practice walking meditation either indoors or outside in nature. The lane doesn\u2019t have to be very long since the goal is not to reach a specific destination, just to practice a very intentional form of walking where you\u2019re mostly retracing your steps.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Start your steps.</strong> Walk 10-15 steps along the lane you\u2019ve chosen, and then pause and breathe for as long as you like. When you\u2019re ready, turn and walk back in the opposite direction to the other end of the lane, where you can pause and breathe again. Then, when you\u2019re ready, turn once more and continue with the walk.</li>\n\t<li><strong>The components of each step.</strong> Walking meditation involves very deliberating thinking about and doing a series of actions that you normally do automatically. Breaking these steps down in your mind may feel awkward, even ridiculous. But you should try to notice at least these four basic components of each step:\u00a0\n\t<p>a) the lifting of one foot;<br>\n\tb) the moving of the foot a bit forward of where you\u2019re standing;<br>\n\tc) the placing of the foot on the floor, heal first;<br>\n\td) the shifting of the weight of the body onto the forward leg as the back heel lifts, while the toes of that foot remain touching the floor or the ground.</p>\n\n\t<p><em>Then the cycle continues, as you:</em></p>\n\n\t<p>a) lift your back foot totally off the ground;<br>\n\tb) observe the back foot as it swings forward and lowers;<br>\n\tc) observe the back foot as it makes contact with the ground, heel first;<br>\n\td) feel the weight shift onto that foot as the body moves forward.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Speed.</strong> You can walk at any speed, but in Kabat-Zinn\u2019s Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program, walking meditation is slow and involves taking small steps. Most important is that it feel natural, not exaggerated or stylized.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Hands and arms.</strong> You can clasp your hands behind your back or in front of you, or you can just let them hang at your side\u2014whatever feels most comfortable and natural.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Focusing your attention.</strong> As you walk, try to focus your attention on one or more sensations that you would normally take for granted, such as your breath coming in and out of your body; the movement of your feet and legs, or their contact with the ground or floor; your head balanced on your neck and shoulders; sounds nearby or those caused by the movement of your body; or whatever your eyes take in as they focus on the world in front of you.</li>\n\t<li><strong>What to do when your mind wanders.</strong> No matter how much you try to fix your attention on any of these sensations, your mind will inevitably wander. That\u2019s OK\u2014it\u2019s perfectly natural. When you notice your mind wandering, simply try again to focus it one of those sensations.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Integrating walking meditation into your daily life.</strong> For many people, slow, formal walking meditation is an acquired taste. But the more you practice, even for short periods of time, the more it is likely to grow on you. Keep in mind that you can also bring mindfulness to walking at any speed in your everyday life, and even to running, though of course the pace of your steps and breath will change. In fact, over time, you can try to bring the same degree of awareness to any everyday activity, experiencing the sense of presence that is available to us at every moment as our lives unfold.</li>\n</ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "id": 7, "rating": "83", "difficulty": "Casual", "title": "Walking Meditation", "description": "Turn an everyday action into a tool for mindfulness and stress reduction.", "duration": ["10", "mins"], "categories": ["mindfulness", "resilience_to_stress"], "img": "https://ggia.berkeley.edu/images/made/assets/general/GGIA-WalkingMeditation_214_162_s_c1.jpg", "frequency": ["1x", "day"]},

They were singled out by researchers Elizabeth Dunn and Michael Norton in their book, <em>Happy Money: The Science of Smarter Spending</em>.</p>\n\n<p>As Dunn and Norton report, these strategies can not only boost our own happiness but help us create more positive giving experiences for children, students, employees, donors, and others.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Make it a choice. </strong>Research suggests that when we feel obligated to give\u2014such as when we feel cornered by an aggressive request\u2014we are less likely to enjoy it. When people we care about ask us to contribute to a fundraiser or loan them money, it can be hard to say no. In these situations it can be helpful to step back and ask yourself, Do I really want to contribute? Remind yourself that it is OK to say no. This may result in less overall giving, but in many cases you may still decide you genuinely want to contribute, and those gifts will feel more gratifying and sincere.</p>\n\n<p>And if you\u2019re soliciting donations from others, keep in mind that even subtle changes to the language you use can make a big difference. Research suggests that if you explicitly remind people that it\u2019s their choice whether or not to help someone in need, they feel happier after they help out, provide higher-quality assistance, and feel a closer sense of connection to the person they helped.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2.\u00a0Make a connection. </strong>Giving to those close to us often feels the best, but we can also use giving as an opportunity to become closer to them\u2014and enjoy greater happiness as a result. For instance, instead of buying a gift certificate for someone, accompany them to the store and buy the gift with them. This will allow you to spend time with them and strengthen your relationship\u2014and you will get to see the smile on their face while they\u2019re enjoying their gift. Even if you\u2019re giving to a stranger, there are often ways to increase the sense of connection, such as by taking the initiative to learn about the recipient. The education funding website <a href=\"http://www.donorschoose.org/\">DonorsChoose.org</a> has tried to create a sense of emotional connection between donors and recipients by helping the donors learn more the teachers and students they are helping, beyond the financial transaction.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Make an impact. </strong>Witnessing the positive impact of a gift in others\u2019 lives is a major source of the happiness. And yet it can sometimes be hard to see how a contribution makes a concrete difference for others. That\u2019s why it \u00a0helps to seek out charities, like DonorsChoose or <a href=\"http://plancanada.ca/spreadthenet\">Spread the Net</a>, that try to make the concrete impact salient for donors. You can also take the initiative to research the causes you support and understand the specific impact of your contribution. <a href=\"http://www.villanova.com/sports/m-basebl/spec-rel/090413aab.html\">See this video</a> of a bone marrow donor meeting the little girl whose life he saved for an example of how powerful it can be to learn about the impact of your generosity.\u00a0</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "id": 15, "rating": "100", "difficulty": "Moderate", "title": "Make Giving Feel Good", "description": "How to encourage kindness in ways that also boost happiness.

For instance, you may want to think twice before telling kids that they\u2019ll get a special treat if they share their toys, or promising them extra TV time if they help clean up after dinner. As tempting as it may be to reward kids when they do something kind, that approach can backfire: They may learn that kindness is only worth performing when they\u2019ll be given some kind of prize as a result. Instead, kids should get to experience the feeling that kindness is its own reward\u2014a view backed up by neuroscience studies showing that pleasure centers of the brain light up when people behave altruistically.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Praise character, not behavior.</strong> Research suggests that children are more likely to make kindness a habit if they are praised for being kind people rather than just for doing something kind. For example, saying, \u201cYou\u2019re such a helpful person\u201d may be more effective than saying, \u201cThat was such a helpful thing to do.\u201d Praising their character encourages children to see kindness as an essential part of who they are and seems to be especially effective around age eight, when children are forming their moral identities.</li>\n\t<li><strong>But criticize behavior, not character.</strong> In other words, it\u2019s OK to induce guilt but not shame. Children who feel guilt (\u201cI did a bad thing\u201d) after wrongdoing are more likely to feel remorse and make amends than those who feel shame (\u201cI am a bad person\u201d). Criticizing a behavior conveys that it\u2019s possible for the child to change his or her behavior and make better choices in the future. Such criticism may be especially effective when it also includes positive affirmation (e.g., \u201cYou\u2019re a good person, and I know you can do better.\u201d)</li>\n\t<li><strong>Model altruistic behavior.</strong> Ultimately, actions speak louder than words when it comes to cultivating altruism. Research shows that when children witness adults behaving altruistically, they are more likely to behave altruistically themselves, regardless of what the adults say to them about the importance of altruism.</li>\n</ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "id": 46, "rating": "100", "difficulty": "Casual", "title": "Encouraging Kindness in Kids", "description": "How to praise kids in ways that make them more kind.", "duration": ["Variable"], "categories": ["kindness"], "img": "https://ggia.berkeley.edu/images/made/assets/general/GGIA-PraisingKidsforKindness_214_162_s_c1.jpg", "frequency": ["1x", "week"]},

[2 seconds] For a few moments, just focus on your breath and clear your mind of worries. Notice when you are breathing in \u2026 and breathing out. Let yourself experience and be aware of the sensations of breathing. [10 seconds]</p>\n\n<p><strong>Loving-kindness &amp; Compassion for a Loved One</strong></p>\n\n<p>Picture someone who is close to you, someone toward whom you feel a great amount of love. Notice how this love feels in your heart.</p>\n\n<p>Notice the sensations around your heart. Perhaps you feel a sensation of warmth, openness, and tenderness. [10 seconds]</p>\n\n<p>Continue breathing, and focus on these feelings as you visualize your loved one. As you breathe out, imagine that you are extending a golden light that holds your warm feelings from the center of your heart. Imagine that the golden light reaches out to your loved one, bringing him or her peace and happiness. At the same time, silently recite these phrases.\u00a0</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>May you have happiness.</p>\n\n<p>May you be free from suffering.</p>\n\n<p>May you experience joy and ease.</p>\n\n<p>May you have happiness.</p>\n\n<p>May you be free from suffering.</p>\n\n<p>May you experience joy and ease.</p>\n\n<p>[1 minute]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As you silently repeat these phrases, remember to extend the golden light to your loved one from your heart. Feel with all your heart that you wish your loved one happiness and freedom from suffering.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Compassion for a Loved One</strong></p>\n\n<p>Now think of a time when this person was suffering. Maybe they experienced an illness, an injury, or a difficult time in a relationship. [15 seconds]</p>\n\n<p>Notice how you feel when you think of his or her suffering. How does your heart feel? Do the sensations change? Do you continue to feel warmth, openness and tenderness? Are there other sensations, perhaps an aching sensation? [10 seconds]</p>\n\n<p>Continue to visualize your loved one as you breathe.\u00a0 Imagine that you are extending the golden light from your heart to your loved one, and that the golden light is easing his or her suffering. Extend this light out to them during your exhalation, with the strong heartfelt wish that they be free from his or her suffering. Recite silently to him or her:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>May you be free from this suffering.</p>\n\n<p>May you have joy and happiness.</p>\n\n<p>May you be free from this suffering.</p>\n\n<p>May you have joy and happiness.</p>\n\n<p>[1 minute]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Notice how this feels in your heart. What happened to your heart? Did the sensations change? Did you continue to feel warmth, openness and tenderness? Were there other sensations, an aching sensation perhaps? Did you have a wish to take away the other\u2019s suffering?\u00a0 [30 seconds]</p>\n\n<p><strong>Compassion for Self</strong></p>\n\n<p>Contemplate a time when you have suffered yourself. Perhaps you experienced a conflict with someone you care about, or did not succeed in something you wanted, or were physically ill. [15 seconds]</p>\n\n<p>Notice how you feel when you think of your suffering. How does your heart feel? Do you continue to feel warmth, openness, and tenderness? Are there other sensations, perhaps an aching sensation? [10 seconds]</p>\n\n<p>Just as we wish for our loved one\u2019s suffering to end, we wish that our own suffering would end. We may also envision our own pain and suffering leaving us so that we may experience happiness.</p>\n\n<p>Continue to visualize yourself as you breathe. Imagine that the golden light emanating from your heart is easing your suffering. With each exhalation, feel the light emanating within you, with the strong heartfelt wish that you be free from your suffering. Silently recite to yourself:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>May I be free from this suffering.</p>\n\n<p>May I have joy and happiness.</p>\n\n<p>May I be free from this suffering.</p>\n\n<p>May I have joy and happiness.</p>\n\n<p>[2 minutes]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, notice how this feels in your heart. What kind of sensations did you feel? Did they change from when you were envisioning your own suffering? How is this feeling different from when you wished your loved one\u2019s suffering to be relieved? Did you feel warmth, openness and tenderness? Were there other sensations such as pressure? Did you have a wish to take away your own suffering? [30 seconds]</p>\n\n<p><strong>Compassion for a Neutral Person</strong></p>\n\n<p>Now visualize someone you neither like nor dislike\u2014someone you may see in your everyday life, such as a classmate with whom you are not familiar, a bus driver, or a stranger you pass on the street. [5 seconds]</p>\n\n<p>Although you are not familiar with this person, think of how this person may suffer in his or her own life. This person may also have conflicts with loved ones, or struggled with an addiction, or may have suffered illness. Imagine a situation in which this person may have suffered. [30 seconds]</p>\n\n<p>Notice your heart center. Does it feel different? Do you feel more warmth, openness and tenderness? Are there other sensations, perhaps an aching sensation? How does your heart feel different from when you were envisioning your own or a loved one\u2019s suffering?\u00a0 [10 seconds]</p>\n\n<p>Continue to visualize this person as you breathe. Imagine that you are extending the golden light from your heart to them, and that the golden light is easing his or her suffering. Extend this light out to them during your exhalation, with the strong heartfelt wish that he or she be free from suffering. See if this wish can be as strong as the wish for your own or a loved one\u2019s suffering to be relieved.\u00a0 Silently recite to him or her:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>May you be free from this suffering.</p>\n\n<p>May you have joy and happiness.</p>\n\n<p>May you be free from this suffering.</p>\n\n<p>May you have joy and happiness.</p>\n\n<p>[2 minutes]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, notice how this feels in your heart. Did the sensations change from when you were envisioning this person\u2019s suffering? Did you continue to feel warmth, openness and tenderness? Were there other sensations? Did you have a wish to take away this person\u2019s suffering? How were these feelings different from when you were wishing to take away your own or a loved one\u2019s suffering? [30 seconds]</p>\n\n<p><strong>Compassion for an Enemy</strong></p>\n\n<p>Now visualize someone with whom you have difficulty in your life. This may be a parent or child with whom you disagree, an ex-girlfriend or boyfriend, a roommate with whom you had an argument, or a co-worker with whom you do not get along. [5 seconds]</p>\n\n<p>Although you may have negative feelings towards this person, think of how this person has suffered in his or her own life. This person has also had conflicts with loved ones, or has dealt with failures, or may have suffered illness. Think of a situation in which this person may have suffered. [30 seconds]</p>\n\n<p>Notice your heart center. Does it feel different? Do you feel more warmth, openness and tenderness? Are there other sensations, perhaps an aching sensation? How does your heart feel different from when you were envisioning your own or a loved one\u2019s suffering? [10 seconds]</p>\n\n<p>Continue to visualize this person as you breathe. Imagine that you are extending the golden light from your heart to him or her, and that the golden light is easing his or her suffering. Extend this light out to him or her during your exhalation, with the strong heartfelt wish that he or she be free from suffering. See if this wish can be as strong as the wish for your own or a loved one\u2019s suffering to be relieved. Silently recite to him or her:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>May you be free from this suffering.</p>\n\n<p>May you have joy and happiness</p>\n\n<p>May you be free from this suffering.</p>\n\n<p>May you have joy and happiness.</p>\n\n<p>[1 minute]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you have difficulty in wishing for this person\u2019s suffering to be relieved, you may think of a positive interaction you have had with this person that can help you in wishing them joy and happiness. Perhaps there were times when you got along, laughed together, or worked well together on an assignment. Continue to silently recite:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>May you be free from this suffering.</p>\n\n<p>May you have joy and happiness.</p>\n\n<p>[2 minutes]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, notice how this feels in your heart. Did the sensations change? Did you feel warmth, openness and tenderness? How were these feelings different from when you were wishing for your own or a loved one\u2019s suffering to end? Were there other sensations, perhaps a tightness in the chest? Did you have a wish to take away this person\u2019s suffering? [30 seconds]</p>\n\n<p><strong>Compassion for All Beings</strong></p>\n\n<p>Now that we are almost at the end of this meditation, let\u2019s end with wish for all other beings\u2019 suffering to be relieved. Just as I wish to have peace, happiness, and to be free from suffering, so do all beings. [10 seconds]</p>\n\n<p>Now bask in the joy of this open-hearted wish to ease the suffering of all people and how this attempt brings joy, happiness, and compassion in your heart at this very moment.</p>\n\n<p>You have now finished this compassion meditation session.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "id": 43, "rating": "83", "difficulty": "Moderate", "title": "Compassion Meditation", "description": "Strengthen feelings of concern for the suffering of others", "duration": ["30", "mins"], "categories": ["featured", "compassion", "connection", "kindness", "mindfulness", "resilience_to_stress"], "img": "https://ggia.berkeley.edu/images/made/assets/general/GGIA-CompassionMeditation_214_162_s_c1.jpg", "frequency": ["1x", "day"]},

Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?</p>\n\n<p>2. Would you like to be famous? In what way?</p>\n\n<p>3.

When did you last sing to yourself? To someone else?</p>\n\n<p>6. If you were able to live to the age of 90 and retain either the mind or body of a 30-year-old for the last 60 years of your life, which would you want?</p>\n\n<p>7. Do you have a secret hunch about how you will die?</p>\n\n<p>8. Name three things you and your partner appear to have in common.</p>\n\n<p>9. For what in your life do you feel most grateful?</p>\n\n<p>10. If you could change anything about the way you were raised, what would it be?</p>\n\n<p>11. Take four minutes and tell your partner your life story in as much detail as possible.</p>\n\n<p>12. If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Set II</strong></p>\n\n<p>13. If a crystal ball could tell you the truth about yourself, your life, the future, or anything else, what would you want to know?</p>\n\n<p>14. Is there something that you\u2019ve dreamed of doing for a long time? Why haven\u2019t you done it?</p>\n\n<p>15. What is the greatest accomplishment of your life?</p>\n\n<p>16. What do you value most in a friendship?</p>\n\n<p>17. What is your most treasured memory?</p>\n\n<p>18. What is your most terrible memory?</p>\n\n<p>19.

What roles do love and affection play in your life?</p>\n\n<p>22. Alternate sharing something you consider a positive characteristic of your partner. Share a total of five items.</p>\n\n<p>23. How close and warm is your family? Do you feel your childhood was happier than most other people\u2019s?</p>\n\n<p>24. How do you feel about your relationship with your mother?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Set III</strong></p>\n\n<p>25. Make three true \u201cwe\u201d statements each.

If you were going to become a close friend with your partner, please share what would be important for him or her to know.</p>\n\n<p>28. Tell your partner what you like about them; be very honest this time, saying things that you might not say to someone you\u2019ve just met.</p>\n\n<p>29. Share with your partner an embarrassing moment in your life.</p>\n\n<p>30. When did you last cry in front of another person? By yourself?</p>\n\n<p>31. Tell your partner something that you like about them [already].</p>\n\n<p>32. What, if anything, is too serious to be joked about?</p>\n\n<p>33. If you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone? Why haven\u2019t you told them yet?</p>\n\n<p>34. Your house, containing everything you own, catches fire. After saving your loved ones and pets, you have time to safely make a final dash to save any one item. What would it be? Why?</p>\n\n<p>35. Of all the people in your family, whose death would you find most disturbing? Why?</p>\n\n<p>36. Share a personal problem and ask your partner\u2019s advice on how he or she might handle it.

Fears related to serious mental illnesses such as post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and social anxiety disorder should be addressed with the help of a mental health professional.</em></p>\n\n<p>Sometimes one or two scary experiences can cause us to fear things that we don\u2019t rationally need to fear; some fears aren\u2019t based on first-hand experience at all. Either way, overcoming these fears often requires that we develop a more positive\u2014or at least less negative\u2014association with the thing that we fear. Here\u2019s how:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Start with small doses.\u00a0The first step is to expose yourself to small doses of the fear-inducing activity in a safe context. For example, if public speaking makes you nervous, you could start by seeking out a low-pressure speaking opportunity with a small, supportive audience, in a setting where you don\u2019t have to worry about being perfectly articulate\u2014perhaps giving a toast at a friend\u2019s birthday party. Or if you\u2019d like to learn to rock climb but are afraid of heights, you could start by spending time observing and assisting other climbers.</li>\n\t<li>Repeat the activity until you start to feel the fear dissipate.\u00a0Over time, repeated exposure to a safe, non-harmful version of whatever made you afraid can reduce the negative association and replace it with a neutral or positive association. For example, repeatedly seeing other people climb without falling may begin to overwrite your negative association with heights. And the more you fly and land safely, the less dangerous flying is likely to feel.</li>\n\t<li>\u00a0Gradually increase the challenge.\u00a0After you begin to feel more comfortable with small doses, try taking it up a notch. For example, you could go from watching others climb to climbing a short distance yourself. Or you could volunteer to present the results of a team project to co-workers or fellow students.\u00a0From here, you can continue to incrementally ratchet up the challenge until you reach your goal, whether that\u2019s to scale Mt. Everest, give a talk in front of hundreds of people, or fly to a new continent.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Your fear may never be fully extinguished, but hopefully it will hold less power over you and not prevent you from achieving important goals and enjoying your life. In the words of Mark Twain, \u201cCourage is not the absence of fear. It is acting in spite of it.\u201d<br>\n\u00a0</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "id": 36, "rating": "0", "difficulty": "Intensive", "title": "Overcoming a Fear", "description": "To reduce stress, try facing your fears head on.", "duration": ["Variable"], "categories": ["resilience_to_stress"], "img": "https://ggia.berkeley.edu/images/made/assets/general/Scary_forest_Fb_214_162_s_c1.png", "frequency": ["1x", "month"]},

Sit comfortably with your feet flat on the floor and your spine straight. Relax your whole body. Keep your eyes closed throughout the whole visualization and bring your awareness inward. Without straining or concentrating, just relax and gently follow the instructions.</p>\n\n<p>Take a deep breath in. And breathe out.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Receiving Loving-Kindness</strong></p>\n\n<p>Keeping your eyes closed, think of a person close to you who loves you very much. It could be someone from the past or the present; someone still in life or who has passed; it could be a spiritual teacher or guide. Imagine that person standing on your right side, sending you their love. That person is sending you wishes for your safety, for your well-being and happiness. Feel the warm wishes and love coming from that person towards you.</p>\n\n<p>Now bring to mind the same person or another person who cherishes you deeply. Imagine that person standing on your left side, sending you wishes for your wellness, for your health and happiness. Feel the kindness and warmth coming to you from that person.</p>\n\n<p>Now imagine that you are surrounded on all sides by all the people who love you and have loved you. Picture all of your friends and loved ones surrounding you. They are standing sending you wishes for your happiness, well-being, and health. Bask in the warm wishes and love coming from all sides. You are filled, and overflowing with warmth and love.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sending Loving-Kindness to Loved Ones</strong></p>\n\n<p>Now bring your awareness back to the person standing on your right side. Begin to send the love that you feel back to that person. You and this person are similar. Just like you, this person wishes to be happy. Send all your love and warm wishes to that person.</p>\n\n<p>Repeat the following phrases, silently:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>May you live with ease, may you be happy, may you be free from pain.\u00a0</em></p>\n\n<p><em>May you live with ease, may you be happy, may you be free from pain.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>May you live with ease, may you be happy, may you be free from pain.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now focus your awareness on the person standing on your left side. Begin to direct the love within you to that person. Send all your love and warmth to that person. That person and you are alike. Just like you, that person wishes to have a good life.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Repeat the following phrases, silently:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Just as I wish to, may you be safe, may you be healthy, may you live with ease and happiness.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Just as I wish to, may you be safe, may you be healthy, may you live with ease and happiness.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Just as I wish to, may you be safe, may you be healthy, may you live with ease and happiness.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now picture another person that you love, perhaps a relative or a friend. This person, like you, wishes to have a happy life. Send warm wishes to that person.</p>\n\n<p>Repeat the following phrases, silently:\u00a0</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>May your life be filled with happiness, health, and well-being.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>May your life be filled with happiness, health, and well-being.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>May your life be filled with happiness, health, and well-being.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Sending Loving-Kindness to Neutral People</strong></p>\n\n<p>Now think of an acquaintance, someone you don\u2019t know very well and toward whom you do not have any particular feeling. You and this person are alike in your wish to have a good life.</p>\n\n<p>Send all your wishes for well-being to that person, repeating the following phrases, silently:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Just as I wish to, may you also live with ease and happiness.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Just as I wish to, may you also live with ease and happiness.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Just as I wish to, may you also live with ease and happiness.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now bring to mind another acquaintance toward whom you feel neutral. It could be a neighbor, or a colleague, or someone else that you see around but do not know very well. Like you, this person wishes to experience joy and well-being in his or her life.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Send all your good wishes to that person, repeating the following phrases, silently:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>May you be happy, may you be healthy, may you be free from all pain.\u00a0</em></p>\n\n<p><em>May you be happy, may you be healthy, may you be free from all pain.\u00a0</em></p>\n\n<p><em>May you be happy, may you be healthy, may you be free from all pain.\u00a0</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Sending Loving-Kindness to All Living Beings</strong></p>\n\n<p>Now expand your awareness and picture the whole globe in front of you as a little ball.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Send warm wishes to all living beings on the globe, who, like you, want to be happy:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Just as I wish to, may you live with ease, happiness, and good health.\u00a0</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Just as I wish to, may you live with ease, happiness, and good health.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Just as I wish to, may you live with ease, happiness, and good health.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Take a deep breath in.

One goal could be to try to use one of these positive strategies\u2014or at least assess the quality of your conflict\u2014once per month.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h4>How to Do It</h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>1. Read the descriptions of the \u201cfour horsemen\u201d below and consider whether you and/or your partner ever engage in any of these behaviors during conflicts.</p>\n\n<p>2. Read the descriptions of the constructive alternatives that can be used in place of the \u201cfour horsemen\u201d and consider how you might put these behaviors into practice, if you have not already.</p>\n\n<p>3. The next time you find yourself in a conflict with your partner, make an active effort to avoid the \u201cfour horsemen\u201d and engage in more constructive behaviors instead. Don\u2019t be too hard on yourself if you slip up\u2014it can be challenging to stay focused during the heat of an argument, and these habits can take time to change.</p>\n\n<p>4. After the conflict, make a note of how things went. Did you or your partner engage in any of the \u201cfour horsemen\u201d behaviors, and if so, did you catch yourself and try to take a different approach during the conflict? What went well, and what could you improve for next time?</p>\n\n<p>5. If/when you feel comfortable, you could invite your partner to participate with you in this practice.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Four Horsemen</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1.\u00a0Criticism.</strong> Some forms of criticism are constructive, but in this case criticism refers to making negative judgments or proclamations about your partner in extreme, absolute terms. A sign that you may be engaging in this more harmful form of criticism is if you catch yourself using terms like \u201cnever\u201d and always\u201d\u2014for example, \u201cYou never think about anyone but yourself!\u201d or, \u201cYou are always so stubborn!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Note that criticism itself is not necessarily a recipe for relationship failure\u2014the problem with criticism is that excessive or extreme criticism can, over time, lead to the more destructive \u201chorsemen.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><strong>Constructive alternative: </strong>There\u2019s nothing wrong with voicing concerns and complaints in a relationship, but try to do so in a way that focuses on your own feelings (and how your partner\u2019s behavior affects you)\u2014for instance, by making \u201cI\u201d statements, like \u201cI feel lonely when you come home late for dinner\u201d\u2014and mentions specific negative behaviors rather than making global attacks on his or her entire personality (\u201cI feel neglected when you make plans without me\u201d rather than \u201cYou are so inconsiderate!\u201d). See the <a href=\"http://ggia.berkeley.edu/practice/active_listening\">Active Listening\u00a0practice</a> for more suggestions along these lines.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Contempt.</strong>\u00a0Contempt is a more destructive form of criticism that involves treating your partner with disrespect, disgust, condescension, or ridicule. It may involve mean-spirited sarcasm, mockery, eye-rolling, sneering, or name-calling. Contempt can grow over time when a person focuses on the qualities they dislike in their partner and builds up these qualities in their mind.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Constructive alternative:</strong>\u00a0Instead of keeping score of all of your partner\u2019s flaws, consider their positive qualities and the things you appreciate most about them. In fact, it may help to write a list of these qualities and return to it when you need a reminder.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Defensiveness.</strong>\u00a0Defensiveness tends to arise when people feel criticized or attacked; it involves making excuses to avoid taking responsibility, or even deflecting blame onto your partner. If you hear yourself saying \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d or blaming your partner for something else after he or she has leveled a complaint against you, ask yourself whether this is really the case. Even if your partner made some mistakes, that doesn\u2019t free you from responsibility for things you could have done differently as well. The problem with defensiveness is that it communicates to your partner that you aren\u2019t really listening to her or taking his concerns seriously. And by introducing new grievances, it can also exacerbate the conflict by making your partner feel attacked and defensive.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Constructive alternative: </strong>Take the time to hear your partner out and take responsibility when appropriate. A simple, genuine apology can go a long way.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Stonewalling.</strong> Stonewalling involves putting up a (metaphorical) wall between you and your partner by withdrawing, shutting down, and physically and emotionally distancing yourself from your partner. An example of stonewalling is to give your partner the \u201csilent treatment\u201d or to abruptly leave without telling your partner where you\u2019re going. Stonewalling can sometimes result when the first three \u201chorsemen\u201d accumulate and become overwhelming. Stonewalling is especially destructive to relationships because it can make one\u2019s partner feel abandoned and rejected.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Constructive alternative:</strong> If you need time out to take a few deep breaths and collect your thoughts, let your partner know, and then return to the conversation when you\u2019re ready. This way, your partner will understand that you are taking care of yourself, not trying to reject him.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "id": 37, "rating": "91", "difficulty": "Intensive", "title": "Avoiding The \u201cFour Horsemen\u201d in Relationships", "description": "Steer clear of these 4 toxic relationship behaviors.", "duration": ["Variable"], "categories": ["compassion", "connection", "empathy"], "img": "https://ggia.berkeley.edu/images/made/assets/general/GGIA-4Horsemen_214_162_s_c1.jpg", "frequency": ["Variable"]},

Of course, reading a story like this is not the only way to elicit awe, and there are many different types of stories that could have this effect. The stories and other stimuli that inspire awe tend to share two key features:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>They involve a sense of vastness that puts into perspective your own relatively small place in the world. This vastness could be either physical (e.g., a panoramic view from a mountaintop) or psychological (e.g., an exceptionally courageous or heroic act of conscience).</li>\n\t<li>They alter the way you understand the world. For instance, they might make your everyday concerns seem less important, or they might expand your beliefs about the reaches of human potential.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Read the story below to experience these dimensions of awe.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imagine you\u2019re getting ready to go on a trip to Europe. Although you\u2019ve seen parts of Europe in photos and on television, you know that seeing things in person will be a completely different experience. You\u2019re particularly excited to begin the trip in one of the most inspiring capitals of the continent\u2014the magnificent city of Paris.</p>\n\n<p>As soon as you arrive in Paris, you\u2019re overwhelmed by the grandeur and beauty of the historic city. The sights, smells, and sounds are like nothing you have ever experienced. Everywhere you look there is something new to capture your imagination. Scanning the view from left to right, you\u2019re surrounded by beautiful buildings. Famous museums and churches beckon for you to absorb the stories of their rich past, while centuries-old hotels and city buildings exude majesty and history. As you pass by them, you\u2019re amazed by the elaborate architectural designs and the ornate details. Between two of the buildings, you catch a glimpse of the Eiffel tower in the distance. Seeing it for the first time in person, your eyes widen and your senses feel wide awake. Although it looks small from where you are, the incredible height of the tower becomes clear as you walk toward it.</p>\n\n<p>Standing a block from the tower, you\u2019re overwhelmed by the sheer size and grandeur of the structure. The intricately woven beams of steel rise high from the ground, and you feel completely dwarfed standing next to it. You look up, but you can\u2019t even see the top. The magnitude of the tower is enormous and it feels even more amazing being there in person than you could have ever imagined. The metal beams rising from the ground are larger than the biggest tree trunks you\u2019ve ever seen. You touch them: As your hands come in contact with the cold metal, you feel the presence of something greater than yourself, not just physically, but in human history. You can\u2019t believe that something so tremendous was built by man.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>You take the elevator to the top. During the ride you can\u2019t help but think back to the first time you saw the Grand Canyon\u2014that moment when everything around you stops as you try to comprehend what\u2019s in front of you. Finally, the elevator doors begin to open, and there it is\u2014Paris all around you. As you take in the overwhelming sight, your mouth opens and you catch your breath. The famed City of Lights stretches for miles in all directions around you, yet from this vantage point the hustle and bustle below cease to exist. As your body is enveloped by a strong feeling of wonder, you scan the enormous panorama and try to take in everything that\u2019s in front of you. You lose yourself in the beauty of the sight.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "id": 35, "rating": "60", "difficulty": "Casual", "title": "Awe Story", "description": "Read a story that will inspire awe.", "duration": ["10", "mins"], "categories": ["awe"], "img": "https://ggia.berkeley.edu/images/made/assets/general/GGIA-AweStory_214_162_s_c1.jpg", "frequency": ["1x", "week"]},

Try to repeat these steps with a different person at least once per week.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h4>How to Do It</h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>1. Think of a person in your life who seems to be very different from you in every way that you can imagine.

Maybe you both have children, or a significant other. Probably you have both had your heart broken at one point or another, or have lost a loved one. At the broadest level, you both belong to the human species, which means that you share 99.9% of your DNA.</p>\n\n<p>3. Review this list of commonalities. How do they make you see this person in a new light? Instead of simply seeing this person as someone unfamiliar to you, or as a member of an out-group, now try to see this person as an individual, one whose tastes and experiences might overlap with yours in certain ways.</p>\n\n<p>4. Repeat this exercise whenever you meet someone who initially seems different from you, with whom you have a conflict, or who makes you feel uncomfortable.\u00a0</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "id": 34, "rating": "90", "difficulty": "Moderate", "title": "Shared Identity", "description": "How to encourage generosity by finding commonalities between people.", "duration": ["15", "mins"], "categories": ["connection", "empathy", "kindness"], "img": "https://ggia.berkeley.edu/images/made/assets/general/GGIA-SharedIdentity_214_162_s_c1.jpg", "frequency": ["1x", "week"]},

We suggest that you move through the steps below based on what works for you.\u00a0</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h4>How to Do It</h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>1.\u00a0Make a list of people who have hurt you deeply enough to warrant the effort to forgive.\u00a0You can do this by asking yourself on a 1-to-10 scale,\u00a0How much pain do I have regarding the way this person treated me?,\u00a0with 1 involving the least pain (but still significant enough to justify the time to forgive) and 10 involving the most pain. Then, order the people on this list from least painful to most painful. Start with the person lowest on this hierarchy (least painful).</p>\n\n<p>2.\u00a0Consider one offense by the first person on your list. Ask yourself:\u00a0How has this person\u2019s offense negatively impacted my life?\u00a0Reflect on the psychological and physical harm it may have caused. Consider how your views of humanity and trust of others may have changed as a result of this offense. Recognize that what happened was not okay, and allow yourself to feel any negative emotions that come up.</p>\n\n<p>3.\u00a0When you\u2019re ready, make a decision to forgive.\u00a0Deciding to forgive involves coming to terms with what you will be doing as you forgive\u2014extending an act of mercy toward the person who has hurt you. When we offer this mercy, we deliberately try to reduce resentment (persistent ill will) toward this person and, instead, offer him or her kindness, respect, generosity, or even love. \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>It is important to emphasize that forgiveness does not involve excusing the person\u2019s actions, forgetting what happened, or tossing justice aside. Justice and forgiveness can be practiced together.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Another important caveat: To forgive is not the same as to reconcile. Reconciliation is a negotiation strategy in which two or more people come together again in mutual trust. You may not choose to reconcile with the person you are forgiving.</p>\n\n<p>4.\u00a0Start with cognitive exercises.\u00a0Ask yourself these questions about the person who has hurt you:\u00a0What was life like for this person while growing up? What wounds did he or she suffer from others that could have made him or her more likely to hurt you? What kinds of extra pressures or stresses were in this person\u2019s life at the time he or she offended you?\u00a0These questions are not meant to excuse or condone, but rather to better understand the other person\u2019s areas of pain, those areas that make him or her vulnerable and human. Understanding why people commit destructive acts can also help us find more effective ways of preventing further destructive acts from occurring in the future.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>5.\u00a0Be aware of any little movement of your heart through which you begin to feel even slight compassion for the person who offended you.\u00a0This person may have been confused, mistaken, and misguided. He or she may deeply regret his or her actions. As you think about this person, notice if you start to feel softer emotions toward him or her.</p>\n\n<p>6.\u00a0Try to consciously bear the pain that he or she caused you so that you do not end up throwing that pain back onto the one who offended you, or even toward unsuspecting others, such as loved ones who were not the ones who wounded you in the first place.\u00a0When we are emotionally wounded, we tend to displace our pain onto others. Please be aware of this so that you are not perpetuating a legacy of anger and injuries.</p>\n\n<p>7.\u00a0Think of a gift of some kind that you can offer to the person you are trying to forgive.\u00a0Forgiveness is an act of mercy\u2014you are extending mercy toward someone who may not have been\u00a0merciful toward you. This could be through a smile, a returned phone call, or a good word about him or her to others.\u00a0Always consider your own safety first when extending kindness and goodwill towards this person. If interacting with this person could put you in danger, find another way to express your feelings, such as by writing in a journal or engaging in a practice such as compassion meditation.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>8.\u00a0Finally, try to find meaning and purpose in what you have experienced. For example, as people suffer from the injustices of others, they often realize that they themselves become more sensitive to others\u2019 pain.

Focusing on people to whom you are grateful has more of an impact than focusing on things for which you are grateful.</li>\n\t<li>Try subtraction, not just addition. Consider what your life would be like without certain people or things, rather than just tallying up all the good stuff. Be grateful for the negative outcomes you avoided, escaped, prevented, or turned into something positive\u2014try not to take that good fortune for granted.</li>\n\t<li>See good things as \u201cgifts.\u201d\u00a0Thinking of the good things in your life as gifts guards against taking them for granted. Try to relish and savor the gifts you\u2019ve received.</li>\n\t<li>Savor surprises. Try to record events that were unexpected or surprising, as these tend to elicit stronger levels of gratitude.</li>\n\t<li>Revise if you repeat. Writing about some of the same people and things is OK, but zero in on a different aspect in detail.</li>\n\t<li>Write regularly. Whether you write every other day or once a week, commit to a regular time to journal, then\u00a0honor that commitment. But\u2026</li>\n\t<li>Don\u2019t overdo it.\u00a0Evidence suggests writing occasionally (1-3 times per week) is more beneficial than daily journaling.

The amount of time the apology takes depends on the nature of the offense and the reparations you plan to make. Try to follow these guidelines anytime you feel you\u2019ve done something that has harmed others.\u00a0</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h4>How to Do It</h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ol>\n\t<li><strong>Acknowledge the offense. </strong>Acknowledging the offense is an essential element of a good apology, but many apologies don\u2019t do this adequately. Apologies are most likely to be well-received if you show that you recognize who was responsible, who was harmed, and the nature of the offense. For example, saying \u201cI made a mistake\u201d is more effective than saying \u201cMistakes were made,\u201d which fails to allocate responsibility. Similarly, acknowledging that harm occurred is better than making vague statements that minimize the legitimacy of the offended person\u2019s grievances (e.g., \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel hurt\u201d) or fail to acknowledge the specific offense (e.g., \u201cI\u2019m sorry for whatever I said yesterday\u201d rather than \u201cI\u2019m sorry for making that insensitive joke\u201d).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Provide an explanation. </strong>In some cases, it\u2019s helpful to explain an offense, especially to convey that it was not intentional and that it will not happen again. But explanations that sound like excuses or blame the victim (e.g., \u201cYou were really getting on my nerves\u201d) tend to be counterproductive. It\u2019s better to say, \u201cThere\u2019s no excuse for my behavior\u201d than to offer a shallow defense.\u00a0</li>\n\t<li><strong>Express remorse. </strong>When you hurt someone, it\u2019s natural to feel shame, humiliation, or remorse. Expressing these feelings communicates that you recognize and regret the suffering you caused. Be careful of phrases like \u201cThat was uncharacteristic of me,\u201d which might convey that you aren\u2019t taking full ownership for what happened. Instead, acknowledge your disappointment in yourself and your commitment to improve.\u00a0</li>\n\t<li><strong>Make amends.</strong> A good apology should include efforts to repair the damage done. Reparation for tangible offenses such as loss of property might involve compensation or replacement, whereas reparation for less tangible offenses such as a violation of trust might involve taking steps to improve your behavior, such as attending marriage counseling. When considering how to best make amends, be sure to ask the offended person what would mean the most to them, rather than simply doing something to relieve your own feelings of guilt. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21245493\">Self-punishment</a>, for example, might alleviate guilt without actually benefitting the victim.</li>\n</ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "id": 20, "rating": "90", "difficulty": "Intensive", "title": "Making an Effective Apology", "description": "A good apology involves more than saying \u201csorry.\u201d ", "duration": ["Variable"], "categories": ["connection", "forgiveness"], "img": "https://ggia.berkeley.edu/images/made/assets/general/Apology_2_214_162_s_c1.png", "frequency": ["Variable"]},

You can try them individually or in combination with one another. Click on the link at the end of each strategy for more detailed instructions on how to perform it.</p>\n\n<p>There are many different creative ways that you can put these principles into practice. We encourage you to share your experience with them in the Comments &amp; Reviews section below.</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li><strong>Create reminders of connectedness.</strong> Research suggests that when people are reminded of human connection, they behave more altruistically, even when those reminders of connection are very subtle. Something as simple as a quote evoking shared goals, words like \u201ccommunity,\u201d or a picture conveying warmth or friendships\u2014they can all have an impact. Take a moment to look around your home, office, or classroom and consider how you could add words, images, or objects that communicate connection. For more on this technique, see the <a href=\"http://ggia.berkeley.edu/practice/reminders_of_connectedness\">Reminders of Connectedness</a>\u00a0practice.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Put a human face on a problem.</strong> Research shows that humans are more likely to want to help others if they see them as individuals, not just abstract statistics. To motivate people to give their time or resources to a cause, like aiding in disaster relief, present them with a personal story of a\u00a0single, identifiable victim, ideally accompanied by a photo. This will help them feel a greater sense of personal connection and concern, especially if they are of a similar age to the victim or have other things in common. It is important not to overwhelm others with too many stories or facts\u2014they can have the paradoxical effect of impeding the urge to give. For more on this technique, see the practice about <a href=\"http://ggia.berkeley.edu/practice/putting_a_human_face_on_suffering\">Putting a Human Face on Suffering</a>.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Encourage identification with \u201coutgroup\u201d members.</strong>\u00a0One of the greatest barriers to altruism is that of group difference: We feel much less obligated to help someone if he or she doesn\u2019t seem to be a member of our \u201cingroup\u201d\u2014we may even feel hostile toward members of an \u201coutgroup.\u201d But research suggests that who we see as part of our \u201cingroup\u201d can be malleable. That\u2019s why a key to promoting altruism is emphasizing similarities that cut across group boundaries. On the broadest level, this could mean remembering that regardless of our political, cultural, or religious affiliations, we are all human beings and share common human experiences.

You can do this while standing, but ideally you\u2019ll be sitting or\u00a0even lying in a comfortable position. Your eyes may be open or closed, but you may find it easier to maintain your focus if you\u00a0close your eyes. It can help to set aside a designated time for this exercise, but it can also help to practice it when you\u2019re feeling particularly stressed or anxious.\u00a0Experts believe a regular practice of mindful breathing can make it easier to do it in difficult situations.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, especially when trying to calm yourself in a stressful moment, it might help to start by taking an exaggerated breath: a deep inhale through your nostrils (3 seconds), hold your breath (2 seconds), and a long exhale through your mouth (4 seconds). Otherwise, simply observe each breath without trying to adjust it; it may help to focus on the rise and fall of your chest or the sensation through your nostrils. As you do so, you may find that your mind wanders, distracted by thoughts or bodily sensations. That\u2019s OK. Just notice that this is happening and gently bring your attention back to your breath.</p>\n\n<p>To provide even more structure, and help you lead this practice for others, below are steps for a\u00a0<strong>short guided meditation</strong>. You can listen to audio of this guided meditation, produced by UCLA\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"http://marc.ucla.edu/\">Mindful Awareness Research Center</a>\u00a0(MARC), in the player below; if it doesn't play, you can find it\u00a0<a href=\"http://marc.ucla.edu/mpeg/01_Breathing_Meditation.mp3\">here</a>\u00a0or download it\u00a0from\u00a0<a href=\"http://marc.ucla.edu/body.cfm?id=22\">MARC's website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>\n<audio autobuffer=\"\" controls=\"controls\" src=\"http://marc.ucla.edu/mpeg/01_Breathing_Meditation.mp3\">\u00a0</audio>\n</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Find a relaxed, comfortable position. You could be seated on a chair or on the floor on a cushion. Keep your back upright, but not too tight. Hands resting\u00a0wherever they\u2019re comfortable. Tongue on the roof of\u00a0your mouth or wherever it\u2019s comfortable.</li>\n\t<li>Notice and relax your body. Try to notice the shape of your body, its weight. Let yourself relax and become curious about your body seated here\u2014the sensations it experiences, the touch, the connection with the floor or the chair. Relax any areas of tightness or tension. Just breathe.</li>\n\t<li>Tune into your breath. Feel the natural flow of breath\u2014in, out. You don\u2019t\u00a0need to do anything to your breath. Not long, not short, just natural. Notice where you feel your breath in your body. It might be in your abdomen. It may be in your chest or throat or in your nostrils. See if you can feel the sensations of breath, one breath at a time. When one breath ends, the next breath begins. \u00a0</li>\n\t<li>Now as you do this, you might notice that your mind may start to wander. You may start thinking about other things. If this happens, it is not a problem. It's very natural. Just notice that your mind has wandered. You can say\u00a0\u201cthinking\u201d or \u201cwandering\u201d in your head softly. And then gently redirect your\u00a0attention right back to the breathing.</li>\n\t<li>Stay here for five to seven minutes. Notice your breath, in silence. From time to time,\u00a0you\u2019ll get lost in\u00a0thought, then return to your breath. \u00a0</li>\n\t<li>After a few minutes, once again notice your body, your whole body, seated here. Let yourself relax even more deeply and then offer yourself some appreciation for doing this practice today.</li>\n</ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>", "id": 22, "rating": "86", "difficulty": "Casual", "title": "Mindful Breathing", "description": "A way to build resilience to stress, anxiety, and anger.", "duration": ["15", "mins"], "categories": ["featured", "mindfulness", "resilience_to_stress"], "img": "https://ggia.berkeley.edu/images/made/assets/general/GGIA-MindfulBreathing_214_162_s_c1.jpg", "frequency": ["1x", "day"]},
